# Palmer Penguins Analysis Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset. The project explores various physical characteristics of penguin species found in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Using R for data analysis and visualization, we dive into the relationships between species and their physical traits.

## Data Source
The dataset, `palmerpenguins`, is included in the R package and offers a simplified alternative to the Iris dataset. It includes measurements such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and species.

## Files Description
- `Palmer Penguin Analysis.R`: R script for data analysis, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- `Penguin Presentation.pptx`: Presentation slides summarizing the findings of the analysis.

## Dependencies
- R
- R Libraries: `tidyverse`, `palmerpenguins`, `dplyr`

## Project Structure
- Data Exploration: Using `glimpse()`, `View()`, and `head()` functions to understand the dataset structure.
- Data Transformation: Conversion of measurement units for easier analysis.
- Data Summary: Calculation of mean and maximum values of physical traits per species.
- Visualization: Scatter plots and trend lines to visualize the relationship between physical traits and species.

## Installation
To run this project, install R and the required libraries. Use the command `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins", "dplyr"))` to install dependencies.

## Usage
Execute the script `Palmer Penguin Analysis.R` in RStudio or any R environment. Ensure the `palmerpenguins` package is loaded.
